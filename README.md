This is a program made to make uploading files and videos not a hassle.

This program is planning to support <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">DropBox</a>, <a href="https://catbox.moe/">Catbox/Litterbox</a>, and <a href="https://filebin.net/">Filebin</a>. (currently this only supports catbox but feel free to change that with a pr)
IMPORTANT NOTICE: This program <u>heavily</u> relies on file sharing services to function, if any of these change or stop functioning, please open a pr, issue or fork if you want.

[insert compiling here]
